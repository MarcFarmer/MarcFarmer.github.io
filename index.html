				<li>Bendu greets Gilfre with "Good morning/afternoon/evening" depending on the time of day.</li>
				<li>Bendu tells the player which hold of Tamriel the amulet is in.</li>
				<li>The quest is enabled by the Story Manager, when the player activates the door on the Workers House.</li>
				<li>The dialogue topic where the player tells Bendu to talk to Gilfre can only be used once (quest variable).</li>
				<li>After the player accepts the quest, a Scene plays where Bendu tells Gilfre he will get the amulet back.</li>
				<li>Bendu and Gilfre have a conversation Scene that gets started by an Actor Dialogue event.</li>

				All tutorials done:
				Level Design Fundamentals, 
				Quest Design Fundamentals, 
				Intermediate Quest Design, 
				Scripting with Papyrus.

					The Royal Adelaide Hospital wanted prototype software to increase adherence to medical protocols in the Emergency Department (ED).
					We evaluated our solution with 8 RAH clinicians; 7/8 would use the web app, 8/8 would use the mobile app.
				</p>
				<p>
					We created a web app for expert clinicians to input and edit the latest evidence-based medical protocols (known as clinical pathways). We created a corresponding mobile app for patient-facing clinicians in the emergency department to interactively follow the medical protocols.
				</p>
				<p>
					I developed the web app in a 2 person team for around half of the duration of the project, then I worked on it individually.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Designed and developed a <a href="https://github.com/MarcFarmer/honours-web-app">Ruby on Rails web app</a> for
						senior clinicians to easily input and edit medical protocols from paper and rich text documents.</li>
					<li>Designed an Android app for ED clinicians to quickly and easily follow the medical protocols. The app was developed by my honours partner.</li>
					<li>Collaborated closely with non-engineer RAH clients to design quick and easy UX and create UI mockups.</li>
					<li>Developed web app UI with Bootstrap, HTML/HAML, CSS/SASS, JQuery.</li>
					<li>Developed database architecture and REST API for the mobile app to search for and request medical protocols in
						JSON format.</li>
					<li>Used Agile Scrum methodology with test driven development (RSpec and Cucumber).</li>
					<li>Presented poster with live demonstration at the universityâ€™s engineering expo (Ingenuity 2015).</li>
